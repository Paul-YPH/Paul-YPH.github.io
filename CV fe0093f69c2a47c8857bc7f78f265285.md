# CV

## **Penghui Yang**

I am currently in my fourth year of the doctoral program (since 2019) in College of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Zhejiang University, under the guidance of Professor [Fan Xiaohui](https://person.zju.edu.cn/fanxh). 

My research is driven by a deep fascination with utilizing computational tools to explore the intricate physiological structures of tissues, the dynamics of disease development and progression, as well as the complex intervention patterns of drugs. My primary research interests encompass the realms of information mining within scRNA-seq datasets, the integration of single-cell multi-omics data, and the pioneering development of spatial omics analysis tools. Currently, I am actively seeking postdoctoral positions in the fields of AI4Science and bioinformatics. If my research resonates with your interests, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
