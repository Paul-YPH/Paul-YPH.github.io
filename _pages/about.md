Beginning at the end of 2024, I will embark on a postdoctoral research journey at the University of Michigan, collaborating with Professor [Zhou Xiang](https://xiangzhou.github.io/). My goal is to contribute to significant advancements in the field while deepening our understanding of biological complexities.

I graduated from the College of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Zhejiang University, where I completed my PhD under the supervision of Professor [Fan Xiaohui](https://person.zju.edu.cn/fanxh). My research interests lie in utilizing computational tools to explore the intricate dynamics of complex physiological structures, disease progression, and multifaceted drug intervention patterns. Specifically, I focus on information mining within single-cell RNA-seq datasets, the integration of single-cell multi-omics data, and the innovative development of spatial omics analysis tools.

In addition to my research pursuits, I have a passion for literature, film, and rock music, which I believe enriches my perspective as a researcher.
