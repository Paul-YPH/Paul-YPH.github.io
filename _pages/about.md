I have graduated from the School of Pharmacy at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of Professor [Fan Xiaohui](https://person.zju.edu.cn/fanxh).
My research interests lie in utilizing computational tools to explore complex physiological structures, the dynamics of disease development and progression, and intricate drug intervention patterns. Specifically, I focus on information mining in single-cell RNA-seq datasets, integrating single-cell multi-omics data, and pioneering the development of spatial omics analysis tools.
I will be joining the University of Michigan for my postdoctoral research, collaborating with Professor [Zhou Xiang](https://xiangzhou.github.io/).
