### One thing I am doing recently:

**Reading _Dream of the Red Chamber_ (红楼梦)**

Currently diving into one of China's classic literary works, _Dream of the Red Chamber_, by Cao Xueqin. This profound novel is renowned for its intricate portrayal of 18th-century Chinese society, family dynamics, and emotional depth. It's a masterpiece that offers a window into the complexities of human relationships and cultural heritage.
